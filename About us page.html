                <center><h1>About Jetwing hotels</h1></center>
                <p>…with a gentle swish another wave met the long sandy shoreline, welcoming another dawn. In the far distance, a solitary man stood gazing out to the brightening horizon. This was a beach he knew inside out, a stretch of coast he loved dearly. He had found his space; being naturally generous, he longed to share it – and so, he dreamed of what it could be, one day…  <br><br>                                     

                    It was another day on the Negombo beach in the early 1970s; he was Herbert Cooray – a visionary, a pioneer of tourism in Sri Lanka and the founding father of Jetwing. The homely villa he built and named Blue Oceanic of just six rooms may have been small, but the heartfelt warmth it offered was immense. It all began with a humble desire to share the experience of true hospitality of a Sri Lankan family with others. A simple dream which grew to an ever furthering vision that made us – the company he founded, what we are today – one of the largest, most respected, and recognized tourism organisations in Sri Lanka, and a family of hotels like no other.</p>

                A majestic spectacle, where wildlife is truly at home… The Gathering at Minneriya, a sight not to be missed, recognised by Lonely Planet as No. 6 on their “10 Greatest Wildlife Spectacles of the World”.

                Of the many extraordinary sights you will witness here, the assembly of over 200 elephants on the shores of the Minneriya Lake every evening at the peak of the dry season is truly outstanding. Fondly termed ‘The Gathering’, this congregation of elephants is the largest in Asia and is said to date back many centuries. The elephants begin to journey towards the diminishing tank waters in June. When the peak of the dry season arrives, the elephants ritualistically assemble daily to graze at the grassy tank bed, reaching a number of many as 250-300.<br><br>

                <b>Galle Fort: A Journey to the Past<br></b>
                Walk the cobbled streets, and tread where the conquerors once resided. Where cultures flourished and traditions stayed, listen closely… you may still hear their voices through the ages.<br><br>
                
                Ever wanted to explore Sri Lanka’s old European past? Come on down to Galle with us; a testament to the island’s colourful past. A major trading point since ancient times, the city is said to have traded with King Solomon, the Persians and the Egyptians.<br><br>
                
                In 1640, the Dutch were able to seize control of Galle. The Dutch, whose influence is still retained in the art and architecture of the city, built The Galle Fort in 1663. Considered a living UNESCO World Heritage Site, the Fort still remains largely unchanged and is home to some of the city’s most celebrated attractions. The British, who were handed the fort in 1796 did not make a great impact on Galle, leaving the Fort a significant monument from the Dutch era.<br><br>
                
                Walking around the Galle Fort is a truly enchanting experience. Stop by the National Museum of Galle and the National Maritime Museum and see the many objets d’art, artifacts and exhibitions on display. Step into the hallowed aisles of the All Saints’ Church and spend a quiet afternoon walking amongst the tombstones at the Dutch Reformed Church. Visit the Old Lighthouse, the Dutch Prison and the Galle Natural Harbour, or see the Old Dutch Gate where the British Court of Arms is carved on the exterior and the Dutch VOC monogram is carved on the interior of the stonework. The Dutch ‘factory’ and hospital also preserve their characteristic architecture although today they have been converted into government offices.<br><br>
                
                Take a closer look at the picturesque, Dutch-style homes that are now mostly occupied by descendants of Moor traders who settled in the fort later. Many homes have also now been restored and converted into chic restaurants, art galleries, jewellery shops and elegant boutique hotels. Finish your adventure with a walk on the famous Ramparts, a spot frequented by families, tourists and young lovers who unwind in the cooling breeze. There is always something, old or new, to discover at the Galle Fort. Take a stroll and be carried away by the old world charm and sophisticated elegance of this wonderful monument.<br><br><br>

                <b>Downtown Historical Visit<br></b>
                The difference between a traveller and a visitor? The history of Negombo, now yours to know…<br><br>
                
                Negombo, located on the West Coast of Sri Lanka, is popularly known as a tourist destination. However, this sunny town has its own rich history and culture, dating far back as the 16th century. Chosen by Moor spice traders for cinnamon production, Negombo served as a major trading point during the Portuguese and Dutch colonial periods. Today, Negombo is equally significant for its centuries-old fishing, cinnamon and brassware industries as well as its luxurious beachside hotels and resorts.<br><br>
                
                Jetwing Lagoon, a charming, eco-friendly resort offers you a delightful holiday experience. Just seven kilometres from the Negombo city centre, the hotel gives you spectacular lagoon views, gentle breezes and chic comfort. Whilst you enjoy your stay, take a day to get to know the city and its people by making a visit with us to the historical downtown area. Much of the art, architecture and culture you will encounter in Negombo are influenced by the Portuguese who took control of the city in the late 16th century and the Dutch who ousted them a few decades later. Discover the Roman Catholic influence of the Portuguese in the ancient St. Mary’s Church of the city. Marvel at its ornate architecture and artworks that gave this town the name ‘Little Rome’. The Anglican Grand Street Church, the Buddhist Agurukaramulla Pansala, and the Sri Muthu Mari Amman Hindu Kovil are symbols of the city’s vibrant past and multi-religious population. Explore the Dutch Fort, built in 1672 by the Dutch who once held monopoly of Sri Lanka’s flourishing cinnamon trade. Surrounded by many other iconic Dutch building, the Fort remains mostly unchanged, even though the city came under British colonists in 1796.<br><br>
                
                As you stroll each historic attraction, stop by and enjoy a typical scene in Negombo. Watch colourful trawlers, catamarans and fishing boats pull toward the shore. Take a look at how local fishermen sell their best and freshest catches. Wander through the little shops selling elegant ceramic and brass ornaments. Watch the city’s fun-loving people go about their daily activities, always with the friendliest smile and warmest spirit. Take an adventure into a city that is truly enchanting, and walk away with your heart satisfied.<br><br><br>
                
                 
                
                <b>Tea Culture Tour<br></b>
                Fancy a cuppa? Only the finest, by Sri Lanka….<br><br>
                
                Ever wondered what goes in to that perfect cup of Ceylon Tea? Let us take you on a scintillating journey through Sri Lanka’s iconic tea industry.<br><br>
                
                Join us on a Tea Culture Tour and take a closer look in to the production of tea in Sri Lanka. Your first stop on this guided tour is the home of a tea plucker, one of the hundreds of bright sari-clad, wicker basket-carrying female workers you will see on the plantations. Here, you will witness a typical day in the life of a tea plucker and learn their history on the island. Next, walk around the plantations and see and learn how tea plucking is actually carried out. Later on in the day, you will have the opportunity to study the extensive process of tea manufacturing in the factory. Finally, sip on many varieties of freshly brewed tea – a refreshing break from a three hour long, informative tour! Enjoy the breathtaking sights of mountain ranges, impeccable tea plantations and plantation communities as you drive to each highlight of the tour.<br><br>
                
                On the drive back to the hotel, step out and take in the view of the magnificent Ramboda Falls. At 109 metres high, Ramboda Falls is Sri Lanka’s 11th highest waterfalls and flows into the Puna Oya Reservoir. Hidden away from the main road and tucked beneath lush greenery, this waterfall is the perfect happy ending to a journey that educates and fills your senses with the unique sights, sounds and tastes of Sri Lankan hill country.</p>
